## Overview

British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.
As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

This project involves two primary tasks:

1. Extracting customer reviews from a website, performing sentiment analysis using NLTK and BERT, and visualizing the results.
2. Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer booking data, generating insights, and using a Random Forest model to predict accuracy.

Note: The above tasks where carried out using google collab

## Task 1: Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

### Web Scraping

- Used web scraping techniques to extract customer reviews from a target website.
- Extracted data includes the review text and other relevant information.

### Sentiment Analysis

- Applied Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for initial text processing and sentiment analysis.
- Utilized BERT Transformer for more advanced and accurate sentiment classification.
- Classified reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories.

### Visualization

- Visualized the distribution of review sentiments using a pie chart to show the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral reviews.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis on Customer Booking Data

### Data Exploration

- Loaded and cleaned customer booking data.
- Explored various features and their relationships within the dataset.

### Visualization

- Generated insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the booking data.
- Used charts and graphs to display the distribution of key variables.

### Modeling

- Implemented a Random Forest model to predict booking outcomes.
- Evaluated the model's accuracy and performance.
